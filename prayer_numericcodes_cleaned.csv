I also pray many times in the early morning when I’m awake but not quite ready to rise out of bed. If I am restless at night and have trouble falling asleep, I pray that God will settle my mind and bring me peace and restful slumber. Then, I add prayers if I’m not yet drowsy. I pray occasionally when I’m driving alone and have that quiet, private time with the Lord. I like to pray while walking my senior dog. When I travel and see beautiful scenery, I thank God for the beauty He has created. Oftentimes, when driving and I see a homeless person or someone struggling in poverty, I ask God to bless that person.
