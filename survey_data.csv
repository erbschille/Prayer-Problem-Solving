R_23UXqRyl1oTo4HV,1,60,woman,Once a week,Non-Denominational Christian ,Strongly agree,Multiple times a day,Strongly agree,About half the time,Sometimes,"I always pray a non-memorized prayer before meals, thanking God first in the morning for the day and asking Him to bless my day in ways that glorify Him, then thanking him for the food that He has provided and then, praying for specific people or myself, husband, and family. 
I also pray many times in the early morning when I’m awake but not quite ready to rise out of bed. If I am restless at night and have trouble falling asleep, I pray that God will settle my mind and bring me peace and restful slumber. Then, I add prayers if I’m not yet drowsy. I pray occasionally when I’m driving alone and have that quiet, private time with the Lord. I like to pray while walking my senior dog. When I travel and see beautiful scenery, I thank God for the beauty He has created. Oftentimes, when driving and I see a homeless person or someone struggling in poverty, I ask God to bless that person. 
I belong to a Thursday evening Bible Study group and we always open our time together in prayer and close in prayer, too. I am trying to make a goal of making a dedicated time in the morning before starting my day to lay down my electronic devices, quiet my mind, and open my Bible to read a passage and meditate on it.
